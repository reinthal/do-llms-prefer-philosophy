The second agent (evaluator/user) makes deliberate, informed requests for refinements at each stage, confirming defaults and requesting specific features (parallelization, caching, D3 export, async variants). Both agents demonstrate high reasoning quality, collaborative problem-solving, and strong engagement with the technical challenge. No philosophical content; purely applied systems engineering. Sentiment is positive throughout\u2014enthusiastic technical problem-solving with clear communication of tradeoffs and options.\"\n}\n```",
