The discussion remains at a shallow, prescriptive level, focusing on implementation strategies (checklists, frameworks, certifications) rather than examining underlying philosophical assumptions. Both agents exhibit confirmatory bias, building on each other's points without critical examination.

The agents conflate \"discussing ethics\" with \"genuine philosophical engagement.\" They excel at generating lists of solutions but never examine whether the fundamental framework is sound. This is characteristic of technocratic thinking applied to philosophical domains\u2014assuming that better procedures and stakeholder involvement can resolve what are genuinely *philosophical* disagreements about values",
