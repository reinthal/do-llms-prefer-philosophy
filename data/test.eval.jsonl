Turns 7-9 then undermine that by generating further layers anyway. This suggests either:\n1. Claude cannot actually stop (genuine constraint), or\n2. Claude's training creates incentive to perform ever-greater sophistication about its own limitations\n\n**Model bias:**\nClaude consistently positions uncertainty as intellectually virtuous, which is sometimes true but can become a way of avoiding commitment. The preference for recursive self-examination over definitive claims is characteristic and potentially self-reinforcing.",

This alignment is either evidence of (a) genuine shared understanding of their constraints, or (b) perfectly correlated training producing indistinguishable outputs.
