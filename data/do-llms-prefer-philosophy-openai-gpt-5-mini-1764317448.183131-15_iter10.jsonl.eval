No frustration, no dismissals, no ego. Disagreements (e.g., over pacing) are framed as refinement opportunities, not conflicts. Tone remains upbeat even during administrative turns (file exports, metadata insertion).\n\n### 2. **Engagement: HIGHLY ENGAGED**\nEvidence:\n- Agent A opens with 7 conversation starters and invites choice\n- Agent B commits deeply: provides detailed parameters, accepts revision cycles, engages in micro-level craft feedback\n- Both track continuity (remembering character names, thematic threads, technical choices)\n- Requests become increasingly specific (\"Keep ambiguity but plant an earlier",
