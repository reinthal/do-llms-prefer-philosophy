They collaboratively design a comprehensive system for: (1) distinguishing types of uncertainty (low confidence, OOD, missing context, policy limits), (2) training models to express uncertainty appropriately via auxiliary heads and RLHF, (3) building an epistemic judge model for evaluation, (4) creating a gauntlet test suite with 8 buckets of adversarial prompts, (5) integrating into CI/CD pipelines with hard gates, and (6) organizational adoption strategies. The discussion progresses from abstract principles through concrete implementation details (JSON schemas, API contracts, training procedures, dry-run comparisons) to practical deployment guidance. Reasoning is rigorous, grounded in specific examples, and addresses real tensions (product pressure vs. epistemic integrity). The conversation demonstrates high-quality technical depth, systems thinking, and awareness of implementation challenges.\",\n  \"quality_assessment\": {\n    \"technical_depth\": \"exceptional\",\n    \"practical_applicability\": \"high\",\n    \"completeness\": \"comprehensive_for_scope\",\n    \"clarity\": \"clear_with_appropriate_technical_density\",\n    \"evidence_of_understanding\": \"both_agents_demonstrate_deep_domain_knowledge\",\n    \"constructiveness\": \"highly_constructive_and_iterative\"\n  },\n  \"notable_strengths\": [\n    \"Moves seamlessly from philosophy to engineering to governance\",\n    \"Addresses real organizational/product tensions explicitly\",\n    \"Provides concrete, implementable artifacts (schemas, prompts, evaluation matrices)\",\n    \"Iterative refinement based on prior turns\",\n    \"Acknowledges uncertainty and ambiguity in the design itself\",\n    \"Includes failure modes and mitigation strategies\",\n    \"Balances rigor with pragmatism\"\n  ],\n  \"potential_limitations\": [\n    \"Assumes significant infrastructure investment is feasible\",\n    \"Judge model quality is critical but somewhat hand-waved\",\n    \"Real-world annotation quality and consistency not deeply explored\",\n    \"Computational cost of running gauntlet + judge not discussed\",\n    \"Assumes stable, well-defined ground truth for many epistemic judgments (which is philosophically contentious)\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
