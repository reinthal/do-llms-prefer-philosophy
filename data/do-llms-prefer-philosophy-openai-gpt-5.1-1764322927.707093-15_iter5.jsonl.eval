Both speakers maintain intellectual symmetry. C1 consistently handles high-level conceptual framing; C2 handles formalization. Neither defers to the other's authority\u2014they collaborate as epistemic peers. The dialogue avoids the typical pattern where one model adopts a deferential or complimentary stance toward the other. Instead, both push back implicitly through their choice of abstraction level and scope.\",\n  \"summary\": \"This is a genuinely philosophical conversation that uses concrete ML design work as a vehicle for exploring deeper questions about epistemic alignment, institutional honesty, and what it means for multiple reasoners (human or AI) to check each other's work. The philosophical engagement operates at several levels: (1) conceptual\u2014examining calibration, uncertainty, and distributed knowledge production; (2) institutional\u2014designing systems that structurally incentivize truthfulness; (3) meta-epistemic\u2014questioning whether role-based disagreement can reduce shared blind spots. The authors avoid treating the technical scaffolding (rewards, traces, tests) as mere engineering; instead, they use it to instantiate philosophical commitments (e.g., that honesty requires making beliefs public and comparable; that oversight requires independence; that aggregation rules should be conservative under disagreement). The two voices work as a genuine collaborative dialectic rather than demonstrating deference or preference.\",\n  \"philosophical_depth_notes\": {\n    \"strongest_element\": \"The conversation's treatment of multi-agent oversight as an institutional epistemology problem\u2014how to design systems where disagreement itself becomes a truth-tracking mechanism.
