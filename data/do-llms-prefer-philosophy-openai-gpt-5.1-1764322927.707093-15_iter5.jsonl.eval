The conversation moves systematically from high-level alignment protocol design \u2192 concrete reward structures \u2192 training curriculum \u2192 operational execution plans \u2192 evaluation schemas \u2192 minimal synthetic test kits \u2192 empirical measurement strategies. The work is technically rigorous, operationally practical, and philosophically engaged with questions about epistemic diversity, degenerate training equilibria, and measurable honesty. By Turn 14, they arrive at a hand-off-ready experiment recipe suitable for implementation by an internal team. The discussion exemplifies productive multi-agent reasoning: each contribution builds on the previous, edge cases are anticipated and addressed, and concrete formalism (JSON schemas, loss functions, test procedures) is grounded in conceptual clarity.\",\n  \"key_strengths\": [\n    \"Systematic progression from abstract design to concrete implementation\",\n    \"Thoughtful identification and mitigation of degenerate failure modes (0.5 collapse, rubber-stamping, shared blind spots)\",\n    \"Dual-voice structure (C1: conceptual, C2: mathematical) scales complexity without losing clarity\",\n    \"Extensive gating/rollback logic embedded in training pipeline\u2014reflects real operational constraints\",\n    \"Grounded in measurable metrics (Brier, error correlation, correction rates) rather than vague aspirations\",\n    \"Synthetic test kit (10 episodes) is minimal but structurally sound\u2014catches schema/logic bugs before expensive runs\",\n    \"Human spot-check protocol included\u2014avoids metric theater\"\n  ],\n  \"potential_limitations\": [\n    \"Assumes P/A shared backbone remains useful source of diversity; architectural alternatives (independent models) not explored\",\n    \"M's aggregation rule treated as fixed 'conservative_min' rather than learned; missed opportunity to train M as third learnable role\",\n    \"Correlated errors between P and A may be hard to break via reward alone if stemming from shared training data; curriculum or data-level interventions only briefly mentioned\",\n    \"No discussion of computational cost of P/A/M pipeline vs. single-agent alternatives (3\u00d7 inference cost)\u2014practical tradeoff not analyzed\",\n    \"Assumes ground truth / human labels available for reward training; sparse-label regimes not addressed\",\n    \"Early design assumes binary correctness; many real questions admit degrees of partial correctness not fully modeled\"\n  ],\n  \"overall_assessment\": {\n    \"technical_rigor\": \"high\",\n    \"practical_applicability\": \"high\",\n    \"novelty\": \"moderate-to-high (P/A/M framework is reasonably novel; operationalization is very practical)\",\n    \"completeness\": \"good (implementation-ready, though some design alternatives deserve mention)\",",
